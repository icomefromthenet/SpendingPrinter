#Spending Printer

I use an application called [TrackMySPEND](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/mobile-apps/trackmyspend?gclid=CM_JlubfqLcCFUNipQodcD8Aqg), to record my daily financial activity. I wanted a way to output my spending that I could print and add to my recepits bundles.

I used phrozn a static site generator and sqlite to generate the reports.
